analogy between FET and RAM architecture 
    
    CPLe & PAL (programmable array logic) are chips 
    were doesnt count many life ciles 

    FPGA SOLVE THIS problem... sOc (system on chip) architecture


Some industry chips :

KRIA KR26 -> specialized on ROBOTIC and VISION

Kria KD240 Drives Starter Kit

# options to manage : 
    1. use MCU t
    2. use FPGA + MCU 
    3. hybrid system (STATES machine,frecuency divider: "with a clkin and clkout w/ 1second
    to this add a 4 bits counter with ENABLE, RESET and CNT; ensure the frecuency at 1hz", etc) 
     

     made a test bench for counter, frecuency divider, etc... "

     for the tb on the frequency divider : simulate a lot of steps  (100millones de ciclos para ver el ciclo de salida)


VIBADO And other develop interfaces, SEE MANAGEMENT 

on this project, have to manage a restrictions file 
clck for the chip (i can use two ), pulser (bottom) to RESET,swithc to ENABLE 
and 4 leds

intern clock for MCU 


remember : pull up -> activate w/ 1. 
P / down : -> defect on 0 


----------------------------------------------------

     # vivado AMD enviroment 

first project on iverilog language

ip integrator (understand block design and define mpogs)
run Simulation 
run LINTER -> isse analizer AND CREATE THE BLOCK DESIGN 

the block design its about a layers: 
    sequential and combitional 

#beatstrim and synthesis design are the elevated computational process 
# all sequential elements should share the same clock 
after the block design confirm :

run synthesis
